Thank you for allowing me to do the Front end challenge. 
I felt happy while doing the challenge. I apologize for my incompleted project submission.
I have tried so many ways to get a JSON file from a link, which is given by you. But I failed with your link. 
While trying with other sample JSON endpoints, I got information from that file. 
I think the problem on my side. 
      
I finished my UI part, I hope you will like that. 
I am very interesting to attend a personal interview .
And I am waiting for your positive response.
Thank you for reading :)
